Project: United States Trip File Generation - Module 2
Author: A.P. Hill Wyrough
version date: 3/15/2014
Python 3.3

Purpose: This is the executive function for Task 2 (Module 2) that assigns a work place to every 
eligible worker. It reads in a state residence file and iterates over every resident.

Dependencies: None

Notes: The structure is inspired by Mufti's Module 2, and get_work_county() helper function is an 
updated version of his.
