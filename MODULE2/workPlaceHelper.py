Project: United States Trip File Generation - Module 2
Author: A.P. Hill Wyrough
version date: 3/23/14
Python 3.3

Purpose: This set of methods and classes provides operations enabling the selection of a work place for a worker. It reads in employment files
for a particular county, creates lists of employers by industry, and provides classes for creating distributions and selecting employers. 

Relies on access to Emp Pat Files For All States and All counties

Dependencies: industryReader.py; countyAdjacencyReader.py

Note: This is all original work, none of these methods are taken from Mufti's Module 2, as they are performed entirely in a new fashion.
